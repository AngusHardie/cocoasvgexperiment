SVG Experiment
===============


This is the code example that goes with my blog post [Exporting SVG From Cocoa](http://www.malcolmhardie.com/weblogs/angus/2013/07/02/exporting-svg-from-cocoa/)



Built in xcode 4.6.3 with 10.8 sdk. It should compile in earlier versions without too much trouble.



The data objects are sort of simplified versions from [SQLEditor](http://www.malcolmhardie.com/sqleditor/), 
but don't do much except sit around waiting to be drawn.

Hope it proves useful. :-)
